#The Road to Sub-Terra

##Beginnings that should have been humbler

Sub-Terra was a project Riley, Logan, and myself all had created back in highschool together.
The game, was simple. Or rather, 'unsimple'. Riley and I were fasicnated with [Daniel Remar's games](http://www.remar.se/daniel/games.php) in highschool, and the ones that served as the seedling for Sub-Terra were [_Hero_](http://www.remar.se/daniel/hero.php), and [_Hero Core_](http://www.remar.se/daniel/herocore.php). We had been running into problems with our games' scopes and artwork, the games were too complex and the art was too difficult to make look 'good'. Don't even get me started on the "Protosian Legends" idea, where I suggested we make **_26_** games (One for each letter of the alphabet) that formed a time loop.
_Hero_ and _HeroCore_, to us, represented something simpler and more achieveable. Could we make a game similar to the likes of _Metroid_ if we simply toned down the graphical level?
We set to work, coming up with ideas, one after the other. Sub-Terra would be about a planet in peril, plagued by fracturing earthquakes. Scientists predicted that the planet of Terra wouldn't have much longer, and had recommended a final evacuation to the stars. You and your team are the final effort to try to figure out what is wrong with Terra, and if possible, save the planet. Your team was not without sponsors, and your actions would be televised to the evacuation ships, so your actions down in the subterranian tunnels would have consequences. However, things don't seem quite right down in the tunnels, things were oddly mechanical when they should have been organic. Who had setup all this equipment down here?

And that was the gist of the story. We had come up with a list of three factions that would try to jockey for your favor. Reaper is the only one I can remember, for a good reason, as they were intended to be the villains. There was also a Neutral faction and an Eco faction, though their names are lost to me. Each faction was intended to have an equivalent array of weapons, though generally Reaper weapons would be more powerful, Eco weapons weaker, even non-lethal, and the Neutral faction being more generic and middle-of-the-road weapons. In essence, siding with Reaper would make the game easier, but lead to the bad end, while siding with Eco would allow you to reach the best ending.
Oh, there was also going to be a time limit.
