# The Road to Sub-Terra

## Beginnings that should have been humbler

Sub-Terra was a project Riley, Logan, and myself all had created back in highschool together.

The game, was simple. Or rather, 'unsimple'. Riley and I were fasicnated with [Daniel Remar's games](http://www.remar.se/daniel/games.php) in highschool, and the ones that served as the seedling for Sub-Terra were [_Hero_](http://www.remar.se/daniel/hero.php), and [_Hero Core_](http://www.remar.se/daniel/herocore.php). We had been running into problems with our games' scopes and artwork, the games were too complex and the art was too difficult to make look 'good'. Don't even get me started on the "Protosian Legends" idea, where I suggested we make **_26_** games (One for each letter of the alphabet) that formed a time loop.

_Hero_ and _HeroCore_, to us, represented something simpler and more achieveable. Could we make a game similar to the likes of _Metroid_ if we simply toned down the graphical level?

We set to work, coming up with ideas, one after the other. Sub-Terra would be about a planet in peril, plagued by fracturing earthquakes. Scientists predicted that the planet of Terra wouldn't have much longer, and had recommended a final evacuation to the stars. You and your team are the final effort to try to figure out what is wrong with Terra, and if possible, save the planet. Your team was not without sponsors, and your actions would be televised to the evacuation ships, so your actions down in the subterranian tunnels would have consequences. However, things don't seem quite right down in the tunnels, things were oddly mechanical when they should have been organic. Who had setup all this equipment down here?

And that was the gist of the story. We had come up with a list of three factions that would try to jockey for your favor. Reaper is the only one I can remember, for a good reason, as they were intended to be the villains. There was also a Neutral faction and an Eco faction, though their names are lost to Riley and I. Each faction was intended to have an equivalent array of weapons, though generally Reaper weapons would be more powerful, Eco weapons weaker, even non-lethal, and the Neutral faction being more generic and middle-of-the-road weapons. In essence, siding with Reaper would make the game easier, but lead to the bad end, while siding with Eco would allow you to reach the best ending.

Oh, there was also going to be a time limit.

That was unfortunately the end of Sub-Terra in that form. We got a little room playable, you could shoot and attack a fly and the TV camera, even wall jump. But we never did get the time limit, the factions, or even the _game_ made. Slightly important that last one.

So Sub-Terra was shelved for a while. I fully never stopped tinkering with the idea though. I tried making Sub-Terra as a turn based game, as a 2.5D platformer (I was quite proud of that one.), and we even considered making it an FPS. A very _DOOM_ inspired one, as we couldn't 3D model but that didn't bother us.

One thing all these iterations had in common: I made a room, sometimes made some enemies, and was generally bored with the work I had made within a month.

## Reigniting the Fire

Years later, I was invited to join a small Discord group of indie game devs by a friend. DevFriends, if the server name is a good identifier. I had been burnt out on the idea of game design for quite some time at that point. But I still had the _drive_ to go and code, I just never had a focus for it. My ideas were always too big and complex (even if I did try to cut them down to size), that I wondered "Why bother?". But DevFriends showed me people working on games, and more importantly the games were _in progress_, marble statues when the idea was still locked in the stone. They helped slowly rebuild my confidence in myself even if I still didn't get any progress with my own projects, but I felt good about starting things again. Still, it was over a year before the embers were stoked again.

Recently, Matt started a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vernaledge/vernal-edge) for their game in May. I've been trying to retweet his posts where I can, but my follower base is small, so I'm probably not helping much. However, this had lead to me being on Twitter more, and Matt would frequently retweet posts about indie games that caught their attention. One, the important one, was [_Exophobia_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189220/Exophobia/)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello!ðŸ‘‹<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PitchYaGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PitchYaGame</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/elev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#elev</a> <br>Exophobia is a modern, clean take on the classic retro first-person shooter gameplay, combining a frightening sci-fi setting, a stylized aesthetic, fast-paced intense combat and metroidvania exploration.<a href="https://t.co/Wwi6E2jLHo">https://t.co/Wwi6E2jLHo</a> (available to wishlist!) <a href="https://t.co/cc2nEqr8qw">pic.twitter.com/cc2nEqr8qw</a></p>&mdash; JosÃ© &#39;Zarc&#39; Castanheira (@jcccastanheira) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcccastanheira/status/1265299622110670848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is it, the tweet that started the chain reaction of me feeling revitalized in my projects. The game sounded right up my alley, and I praised JosÃ© for their work in making a 3D FPS in _Game Maker_, which is notorious for not being great at that sort of thing. Then, JosÃ© said something wonderful: 

> Everything in my game can be done with GM8 :) Don't worry, I'm also not 100% sure how the 3D works in GMS:2, it was a lot of trial and error lol

Something about the idea that this person fought with the same commands I had, and through trial and error, managed to make a game that looked crisp, fun, and engaging resonated with me. I set to work coding well into the night, and the two days later revealed this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How you managed to make a whole game with 3D will forever astound me. <a href="https://twitter.com/ganbariley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ganbariley</a> had our own idea for a metroidvania that at one point was going to be a 3D one as well.

And I've kept plugging along at it since, which admittedly hasn't been long so far, but it feels like something's changed. The air is electric, and even when I've been getting frustrated with my code, it's not deterred me yet.

I implemented a basic enemy, reimagining a sprite from Sub-Terra DX's days:

### Astute viewers may recognize _DOOM_'s E1M1

I also added some of the old tracks Logan had made back in our highschool days for the original Sub-Terra. I still think they hold up today, and I would even occasionally listen to them while I biked to work at Dairy Queen. Thinking about the music, I relayed my thoughts about the tracks to Logan, and later asked if he would be willing to make more. He agreed, and I lamented that I needed to sit down and actually plan out Sub-Terra at some point, as I've shown that my ideas are wide but very shallow. Logan suggested I watch Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw's [gamedev diary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFERI12uu5pltdQ40tPXm9j1ENoAG3wgH) as he explained the idea of focusing on a series of core "loops".

Yahtzee then proceeded to slap me in the face.

> If all you do is start projects and eventually give up on them then you have as much right to call yourself a creative as someone who spent the equivalent time in a wooden box.

That right there, it was me. Every single coding project I had done, I had given up on. Yahtzee had his hooks in me at that point, so I kept watching, and he eventually explained the idea of the core gameplay loop that Logan mentioned. Essentially the gist is this:

- You start with your primary loop, the second to second gameplay
	- What is a player doing at any given moment?
	- How do they run, jump? What abilities do they have?
	- What obstacles do they have to deal with?
- Once that's refined, you go to your secondary loop, the minute to minute gameplay
	- What is their current goal? Not current quest or anything, but 'goal'?
	- Is the goal to reach the end of the level?
	- Clear the room of obstacles?
- Only then can you go to the tertiary loop, the overall mission or story

Yahtzee compared this to the story of the development of _Super Mario 64_, where Shigeru Miyamoto allegedly spent a large time of its development with only Mario in an empty room tweaking, refining, and polishing Mario's movement. (By the way, supposedly at the time Mario was just a cube.) Look where that got them, with one of the best movement systems of that era. You can even see how this advice stuck to me as well. Over the first couple of days, I was adding new features and new toys to play with. Enemies, a gun, doors, switches, pits. But after the 30th, most of my following posts were about making one mechanic work better: The ledge hang.

Once I got the hanging down, I wanted to make it so you could slide side to side on the ledge, or shimmy across it as I called it. Not sure where I got that term, as it's not quite the same thing. My current collision code, would not allow for it though, or at least wouldn't without making a lot of hardcoded assumptions that would be hard to fix later. So I started to rewrite the code for it over the next day, and late June 1st after a frustrating day of debugging, I had it working:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haha... hahahaha! HAHAHAHA!!<br><br>YES I GOT THE NEW COLLISION WORKING! Now to fix up effects and finally make shimmying<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indiedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#indiedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gamedev</a> <a href="https://t.co/pK3O2neQS6">pic.twitter.com/pK3O2neQS6</a></p>&mdash; Dustimancer (@RuinsOfDust) <a href="https://twitter.com/RuinsOfDust/status/1267655770834755584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then, after we had ticked over into the AM hours of the 2nd, the sliding:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One last thing for tonight. Shimmy shimmy shake!<br><br>Ledge transferring is still something I need to work on. It&#39;s *technically* possible already as you can see below... just janky as eff.

My current methods for level generation though, don't leave me a lot of room to test that ledge transferring I want to do, however. So I've put the main coding on pause for now, and am working on a level editor so I can setup a real "testing" environment that I can use to really polish my movement. My empty room won't be so empty, but it will be spartan.

And that's it, _so far_! I may come back and update this page later as progress happens, or as memories possibly come back about Sub-Terra, though the latter's unlikely. I mostly want this new iteration to be what _it_ needs to be, rather than relying entirely on the concepts I had put into place years ago and smashing them into whatever new-fangled format I've come up with.
