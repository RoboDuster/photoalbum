# The Road to Sub-Terra

## Beginnings that should have been humbler

Sub-Terra was a project Riley, Logan, and myself all had created back in highschool together.

The game, was simple. Or rather, 'unsimple'. Riley and I were fasicnated with [Daniel Remar's games](http://www.remar.se/daniel/games.php) in highschool, and the ones that served as the seedling for Sub-Terra were [_Hero_](http://www.remar.se/daniel/hero.php), and [_Hero Core_](http://www.remar.se/daniel/herocore.php). We had been running into problems with our games' scopes and artwork, the games were too complex and the art was too difficult to make look 'good'. Don't even get me started on the "Protosian Legends" idea, where I suggested we make **_26_** games (One for each letter of the alphabet) that formed a time loop.

_Hero_ and _HeroCore_, to us, represented something simpler and more achieveable. Could we make a game similar to the likes of _Metroid_ if we simply toned down the graphical level?

We set to work, coming up with ideas, one after the other. Sub-Terra would be about a planet in peril, plagued by fracturing earthquakes. Scientists predicted that the planet of Terra wouldn't have much longer, and had recommended a final evacuation to the stars. You and your team are the final effort to try to figure out what is wrong with Terra, and if possible, save the planet. Your team was not without sponsors, and your actions would be televised to the evacuation ships, so your actions down in the subterranian tunnels would have consequences. However, things don't seem quite right down in the tunnels, things were oddly mechanical when they should have been organic. Who had setup all this equipment down here?

And that was the gist of the story. We had come up with a list of three factions that would try to jockey for your favor. Reaper is the only one I can remember, for a good reason, as they were intended to be the villains. There was also a Neutral faction and an Eco faction, though their names are lost to me. Each faction was intended to have an equivalent array of weapons, though generally Reaper weapons would be more powerful, Eco weapons weaker, even non-lethal, and the Neutral faction being more generic and middle-of-the-road weapons. In essence, siding with Reaper would make the game easier, but lead to the bad end, while siding with Eco would allow you to reach the best ending.

Oh, there was also going to be a time limit.

That was unfortunately the end of Sub-Terra in that form. We got a little room playable, you could shoot and attack a fly and the TV camera, even wall jump. But we never did get the time limit, the factions, or even the _game_ made. Slightly important that last one.

So Sub-Terra was shelved for a while. I fully never stopped tinkering with the idea though. I tried making Sub-Terra as a turn based game, as a 2.5D platformer (I was quite proud of that one.), and we even considered making it an FPS. A very _DOOM_ inspired one, as we couldn't 3D model but that didn't bother us.

One thing all these iterations had in common: I made a room, sometimes made some enemies, and was generally bored with the work I had made within a month.

## Reigniting the Fire

Years later, I was invited to join a small Discord group of indie game devs by a friend. DevFriends, if the server name is a good identifier. I had been burnt out on the idea of game design for quite some time at that point. But I still had the _drive_ to go and code, I just never had a focus for it. My ideas were always too big and complex (even if I did try to cut them down to size), that I wondered "Why bother?". But DevFriends showed me people working on games, and more importantly the games were _in progress_, marble statues when the idea was still locked in the stone. They helped slowly rebuild my confidence in myself even if I still didn't get any progress with my own projects, but I felt good about starting things again. Still, it was over a year before the embers were stoked again.

Recently, Matt started a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vernaledge/vernal-edge) for their game in May. I've been trying to retweet his posts where I can, but my follower base is small, so I'm probably not helping much. However, this had lead to me being on Twitter more, and Matt would frequently retweet posts about indie games that caught their attention. One, the important one, was [_Exophobia_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189220/Exophobia/)

This is it, the tweet that started the chain reaction of me feeling revitalized in my projects. The game sounded right up my alley, and I praised JosÃ© for their work in making a 3D FPS in _Game Maker_, which is notorious for not being great at that sort of thing. Then, JosÃ© said something wonderful: 

> Everything in my game can be done with GM8 :) Don't worry, I'm also not 100% sure how the 3D works in GMS:2, it was a lot of trial and error lol

Something about the idea that this person fought with the same commands I had, and through trial and error, managed to make a game that looked crisp, fun, and engaging resonated with me. I set to work coding well into the night, and the two days later revealed this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How you managed to make a whole game with 3D will forever astound me. <a href="https://twitter.com/ganbariley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ganbariley</a> had our own idea for a metroidvania that at one point was going to be a 3D one as well.

And I've kept plugging along at it since, which admittedly hasn't been long so far, but it feels like something's changed. The air is electric, and even when I've been getting frustrated with my code, it's not deterred me yet.

I implemented a basic enemy, reimagining a sprite from Sub-Terra DX's days:

I also added some of the old tracks Logan had made back in our highschool days for the original Sub-Terra. I still think they hold up today, and I would even occasionally listen to them while I biked to work at Dairy Queen. Thinking about the music, I relayed my thoughts about the tracks to Logan, and later asked if he would be willing to make more. He agreed, and I lamented that I needed to sit down and actually plan out Sub-Terra at some point, as I've shown that my ideas are wide but very shallow.
